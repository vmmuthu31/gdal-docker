Overview:

This diagram represents the high-level architecture of our Geospatial Python Runtime system. It illustrates the interaction between various components, from user requests to the processing and storage of geospatial data.
Components:

User Requests: Users send HTTP requests containing geospatial data, such as geometry boundaries.
API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for all user requests. It routes these requests to the appropriate services, handles authentication, rate limiting, and other API management tasks.
Python Runtime Environment: This consists of Docker containers running Python functions. Each container has GDAL and other required libraries installed. The containers are managed by Kubernetes for scalability and orchestration.
Function Management Service: Manages user-defined functions (UDFs). It handles the creation, deletion, and updates of UDFs, ensuring each function runs in an isolated environment.
Storage: This is the persistent storage for large datasets (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage). It stores input data, intermediate results, and final outputs.
Results: Processed data is returned to the user via the API Gateway. This can include image tiles, analysis results, or other geospatial data.
Flow:

Users send requests to the API Gateway.
The API Gateway routes these requests to either the Python Runtime Environment for processing or the Function Management Service for managing UDFs.
The Python Runtime Environment processes the data and interacts with the Storage for saving datasets.
Processed results are stored and then sent back to the user through the API Gateway.
Key Points:

Scalability: The use of Kubernetes ensures that our system can scale according to demand.
Isolation: Each user-defined function runs in an isolated environment, enhancing security and reliability.
Flexibility: The system can handle various geospatial data processing tasks and manage large datasets effectively.
